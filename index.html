                    <h2>Common Boiler Problems and Their Impact</h2>
                    <p>A malfunctioning boiler can cause various problems, ranging from reduced heating efficiency to complete breakdowns. It’s crucial to address these issues promptly to avoid further damage and inconvenience. Here are some common boiler problems you may encounter:</p>
                    <h3>Uneven Heating and Insufficient Hot Water</h3>
                    <p>If you notice cold spots or inconsistent heating in different areas of your property, it may indicate an underlying issue with your boiler. Similarly, insufficient hot water or sudden drops in temperature during showers can be signs of a malfunctioning boiler.</p>
                    <h3>Strange Noises and Odors</h3>
                    <p>Unusual noises such as banging, whistling, or gurgling coming from your boiler should not be ignored. These sounds can indicate problems like airlocks, a faulty pump, or mineral deposits. Additionally, strange odors, such as a sulfur-like smell, could signal a gas leak, requiring immediate attention for safety reasons.</p>
                    <h3>Boiler Leaks</h3>
                    <p>Water leaks around your boiler are clear indicators of a problem. Leaks can occur due to issues with valves, pressure relief pipes, or internal components, potentially leading to water damage and further system malfunctions.</p>
                    <h3>Ignition Failures</h3>
                    <p>If your boiler fails to ignite or experiences frequent ignition failures, it may result in a complete loss of heating or hot water. Ignition problems can stem from issues with the pilot light, thermocouple, or electronic ignition system.</p>
